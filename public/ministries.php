        <h2>Adult Ministries</h2>
        <p>Our small groups are based on a community of believers that center around Fellowship, Scripture, Prayer, and Mission. A small group is the primary way to connect with others at Shalom of Bay City and grow as a follower of Jesus. We strongly encourage all our members to join one of our small groups <a class="btn btn-default" href="smallgrp.php">Find a Group</a></p>
