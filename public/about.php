    <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>Here in Shalom of Bay City Church, we believe in coming as you are. There is no pretense. You don&#8217;t have to act like a Christian or believe what we believe to belong here.  We&#8217;re simply a group of people who are passionate about Jesus and His church.  No matter what you think about God or church, you are welcome here to experience Real Worship, to Love Others, and to Serve Now. (Matthew 28:18-20, Jeremiah 29:11-13).</p>
