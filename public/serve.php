        <h2>Serve</h2>
            <p>At Shalom of Bay City Church, service is a way of life. We don’t shy away from getting our hands dirty. Instead, we’re embracing the needs of our surrounding communities and consistently using the time and talents God’s given us to help everyone connect with Christ.</p>

            <p>Be part of the crowd that comes out on designated Saturdays to go out and participate in service projects throughout the community. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about the needs of your neighbors, meet those needs in a practical way, and really get to know the people surrounding you in church on Sundays. We hope that WeSERV is a time when people can take their first step in serving others and can continue to serve regularly in the community. </p>
